![Complexity analysis](../assets/covers/chapter_complexity_analysis.jpg){ class="cover-image" }

!!! abstract

    Complexity analysis is like a space-time navigator in the vast universe of algorithms.

    It guides us in exploring deeper within the the dimensions of time and space, seeking more elegant solutions.
