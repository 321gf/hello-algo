![Stack and Queue](../assets/covers/chapter_stack_and_queue.jpg){ class="cover-image" }

!!! abstract

    A stack is like cats placed on top of each other, while a queue is like cats lined up one by one.
    
    They represent the logical relationships of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO), respectively.
