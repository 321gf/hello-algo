# Chapter 4. &nbsp; Arrays and Linked Lists

![Arrays and Linked Lists](../assets/covers/chapter_array_and_linkedlist.jpg){ class="cover-image" }

!!! abstract

    The world of data structures is like a solid brick wall.

    The bricks of an array are neatly arranged, each closely connected to the next. In contrast, the bricks of a linked list are scattered, with vines of connections freely weaving through the gaps between bricks.
